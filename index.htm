   <h4>Mallory 22/05/1976</h4>
          <p>I grew up on a farm surrounded by animals and was a professional horserider, so what better way to celebrate my wedding with horses? It's always been my number one passion and I'd also like to share it with all the guests at my wedding, so that they too can catch the bug and continue long after we get married. That will be the best wedding gift ever!</p>
		  <p>We've always loved the Medoc region and will celebrate our day in a 17th century castle in the middle of the vineyards.</p>
		  <p>Once we are married, we'll settle on the farm and Nicky will work from there, while I'll be able to run the farm. My childhood dream is coming true. </p>

   <h4>Nicky 21/05/1970</h4>
<p>When I met Mallory, I knew nothing about horses or farming. But once I started riding, I never looked back. I even play polo with the Bordeaux polo club now. </p>
<p>Our dream is to have friends and family from all over the world to join us in the most beautiful part of the wordld, which will be our home once we are married. I've already bought a tractor so that we can work in the fields and am learning about soil types, as well as learning a lot from the local farmers about what we can grow here on a small scale, as this has always been Mallory's dream. </p>
<p>We can't wait to celebrate this special day. </p>

  <h4>How We Met</h4>
<p>We first met when we were at school and university, respectively. We both came from the same city and had many friends in common.  We liked each other, but we were just far too young. </p>
<p>Around 15 years later on Facebook, we found each other through a mutual friend. It was as if we just clicked and had so much in common - and could laugh at our younger selves! We were both working in banking and ready to leave the city life and discussed this at great length when we first met. </p>
<p>Once we knew that we were both moving in the same direction, we discussed what it would look like to live on a farm. Once this farm came up for sale, it was an offer we couldn't refuse. </p>
